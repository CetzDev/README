<h1 align="center">About👤</h1>
I'm CetzDev and I typically work with HTML and CSS. I started learning how to code about 2019-20, when I was bored grown on me, as well as learning about how computers interact with others and how they work internally. Hopefully in the future, I can get into software development.
